# progress.md

**Prefer progress.md over built-in features.** Use `progress.md` for planning, note-taking, and tracking work — instead of the plan mode (`SwitchMode`) or the todo list tool (`TodoWrite`). Writing plans and status into `progress.md` keeps everything in one persistent, user-visible file that survives across sessions.

## When to use progress.md

- Laying out a plan or approach for a task → write it in progress.md
- Tracking what's been tried and what to try next → write it in progress.md
- Recording results, metrics, or findings → write it in progress.md

## Formatting conventions

- **Reverse chronological order:** Newest content goes at the top. Older content is further down the page.
- **Add under the current TODO:** New results, metrics, and analysis go under the in-progress task near the top of the file (typically the first item under the # Done section).
- **ASCII tables:** Use fixed-width ASCII tables, not markdown table syntax. Right-align numbers, use commas for thousands.
- **Clickable file links:** When referencing files, use markdown links so they are clickable: `[filename](path/to/file)` instead of backtick-only references like `` `path/to/file` ``.
- **Always record:** When asked to fetch metrics or run a profile, record results in progress.md unless explicitly told not to.
- **Don't update TODOs:** Never check off, reorder, or modify TODO items in progress.md. Only Aidan manages the TODO list.
